 1. fixed all Machalis-Menton models; e.g., 
    dCp(t)/dt = - Vmax*Cp(t)/(Km + Cp(t)), C(0) = Dose/Vd
    for all fitting and simulation codes.
 2. fixed demo(mmpk);
 3. fixed read.csv(...,Header=TRUE,...) in data.manipulate() 
    to correctly import simulated dataset (savefile()); after
    read.csv() re-assign col.names = cname = 
    c("Subject", "time", "conc");
 4. added the list of input data & initial values for 
    pk parameters;
 5. fixed fzero.nolag();
 6. included 'Dose' input in parameter initial values;
 7. rearranged output formats;
 8. added display the output file directory at final step;
 9. added a 3-compartment, iv bolus pk model with 1st-ordered elim.
10. added "Variance-Covariance Matrix" in the output
11. decided to switch to nlsLM() from package minpack.lm from this
    release; the default method 'LM' (the Levenberg-Marquardt 
    algorithm) is used in PKfit; nlsLM(...,"weight=NULL",...) as 
    default; we used external setup for weighting scheme to make 
    the minimum code change;
12. fixed simulation for iv bolus with 2-compartment, 1st-ordered
    pk model;
13. fixed smacro.one(), smacro.two() and smacro.three(); removed
    'Dose' from the arguments of smacro.one.out(...), etc.; no 
    Dose is req.;
14. fixed szero.nolag() with Monte-Carlo sim.;
15. added the function of input data file could be saved as a .csv
    format too (with write.csv(...,col.names=TRUE,,,).

---
1. Remove genetic algorithm from PKfit; it still keep
   Nelder-Mead Simplex (optim) and nls() for Guass_newton.
2. fixed some settings for methods used in model-fitting.
   most difficult in this part.
3. If you get error message something like 'minFactors...',
   please check your model, check your data and check your
   initial values.
4. A .txt output and a .pdf file generated for fitting
   results and plots, respectively.
